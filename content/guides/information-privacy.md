## How We Protect Your Privacy

We are committed to ensuring that your personal information remains secure and private. Here are the key steps we take to protect your data:

### Client-Side Data Anonymization

Before your data is transmitted to our secure storage, we remove all personalized information directly on your device. This process ensures that only anonymized data is sent, keeping your personal details private.

### Separate Linking of Your Data

Your TikTok data is exclusively connected to your depression risk survey (PHQ-9) using a randomized and anonymized identifier. This ID is not linked to any of your personal information, ensuring that your survey responses and video history remain separate and untraceable to you.

### Secure Data Storage

We utilize a secure and reliable database solution to store your anonymized data. Our storage systems are designed to protect your information from unauthorized access and breaches.

### Ethical Oversight

Our privacy practices are reviewed and approved by an Ethical Review Committee, ensuring that we adhere to the highest standards of data protection and ethical responsibility.

### Data Confidentiality

Your data is never shared with third parties. We maintain strict confidentiality to ensure that your information remains solely within our secure systems.

By implementing these measures, we prioritize your privacy and strive to provide a safe and trustworthy experience.
