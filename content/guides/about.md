# About This Study

## Title

**Leveraging Social Media Data and AI to Predict Risk of Depression Using TikTok Algorithms**

## Purpose

This study aims to explore how **TikTok video data** and **PHQ-9 scores** can be analyzed using AI to predict the risk of depression. By identifying patterns in TikTok content and user behavior, we hope to develop tools for **early detection** of mental health concerns.

## Research Team

- **Daniel Korkin**
- **Vikram Hiranandani**

## Procedure

Participants will:

1. Submit their **PHQ-9 scores**.
2. Provide **TikTok data** downloaded from their account settings.
3. Complete an **informed consent form**.

The AI model will analyze linguistic, visual, and behavioral patterns in the TikTok data to assess the risk of depression.

## Confidentiality

- All data will be **anonymized** before submission.
- Personal identifiers will be stripped from the TikTok data.
- PHQ-9 scores will be linked to TikTok data only as anonymized datasets.

## Risks and Benefits

### Risks:

- **Minimal risk** as all data is anonymized before leaving the participantâ€™s device.

### Benefits:

- Contribution to mental health research.
- Potential to improve early screening tools for depression.

## Voluntary Participation

- Participation is completely **voluntary**.
- Participants can **withdraw at any time** without consequences.
